  Today, Google honored the birthday of computer science pioneer Admiral Grace Hopper with a very special <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/12/09/google-doodle-honors-grace-hopper-early-computer-scientist/">doodle</a>. The doodle, and subsequent Google searches had people discussing Admiral Hopper's career and learning new things about the history of computer science and the role of women in that history. Digging around <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">wikiquote</a>, I found that a few of the quotes
  that I may repeat on any given work day were first said by Admiral Hopper (eg: "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission"). While I knew that she spent her early career
  programming on mainframe computers, I also didn't know that she was considered to be a
  co-founder of the COBOL language.

  While all of this love for women in computer science is great and worthy of a separate conversation, what motivated me to make a post was the online discussions that stemmed from Admiral Hopper's doodle. In multiple forums, people lamented that Grace Hopper was different because she was successful in a field that was and is dominated by men. This immediately made me think of an article that I read recently in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/when-computer-programming-was-womens-work/2011/08/24/gIQAdixGgJ_story_1.html">Washington Post</a>, which talks about how until the mid-80s, computer science was "women's work."
