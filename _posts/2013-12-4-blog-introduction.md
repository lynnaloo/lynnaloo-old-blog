This is the first post in a blog that is the result of some experimentation into methods of creating and maintaining simple blogs. This experience started with some of the mainstream blogging platforms such as Wordpress and Tumblr, continued into exploration into the open-source realm of the Ghost blogging platform, and finally settled on Jekyll/Github Pages.

#### What I was looking for

* Free/really cheap hosting without ads
* Open-source
* Integration with Github
* Some, but not a ton of coding
* Ability to use some elements from Bootstrap or other mainstream frameworks

#### Things I had to consider about myself

* I have a background in design, but I'm not a designer
* I only have a basic working knowledge of Ruby and PHP
* I want to have a lot of control over the layout and functionality
* I want to write Javascript
* I'm ultimately lazy about writing blog content and it's going to have to be easy/fun to post

#### Benefits of Jekyll

* Github pages offers free-hosting and use Jekyll as their default parsing engine
* It's ridiculously simple to setup a development environment
* Github pages has a bunch of basic templates that you can use for a decent-looking site to start with
* The official [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) web site looks great and has a ton of documentation
* I was able to quickly find a lot of great examples of cool open-source blogs on Github and postings from other people talking in detail about how they worked on their blogs, like [Eric Jones](http://erjjones.github.io/blog/How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day/))

#### The way forward

I've been exploring a lot of frameworks and blogs using a hybrid of Jekyll and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), but to start I just created the most basic functioning blog that doesn't look awful. My plan is to first clean up the default generated html/css and separate it into templates, then to manually integrate the latest version of Bootstrap, and finally add some personality in the way of code and graphics. Those three steps will likely just be phase 1 of an on-going project to keep making this site better with newer and better tools. It may also just be the temporary tinkering with Jekyll and may be re-written in a few months.

See future posts for updates on the journey...
