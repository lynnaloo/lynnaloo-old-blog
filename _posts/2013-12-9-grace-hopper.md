  Today, Google honored the birthday of computer science pioneer Admiral Grace Hopper with a very special <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/12/09/google-doodle-honors-grace-hopper-early-computer-scientist/">doodle</a>. The doodle, and subsequent Google searches had people discussing Admiral Hopper's career and learning new things about the history of computer science and the role of women in that history. Digging around <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">wikiquote</a>, I found that a few of the quotes
  that I may repeat on any given work day were first said by Admiral Hopper (eg: "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission"). While I knew that she spent her early career
  programming on mainframe computers, I also didn't know that she was considered to be a
  co-founder of the COBOL language.

  While all of this encouragement for women in computer science is great and worthy of a separate conversation, what motivated me to write was the online discussions that stemmed
  from Admiral Hopper's doodle. In multiple forums, people lamented that Grace Hopper was different because she was successful in a field that was and is dominated by men. This immediately made me think of an article that I read recently in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/when-computer-programming-was-womens-work/2011/08/24/gIQAdixGgJ_story_1.html">Washington Post</a>, which illustrated how until the mid-80s, computer science was "women's work." Computer science wasn't a "real" science afterall and required a woman's talent with planning and scheduling tasks - like making a pot roast. More than 50 years ago, in a time when women were rarely considered to be equal to men in any field, they were writing computer programs in record
  numbers.

  During her career, Grace Hopper was purely outstanding as a computer scientist.
  She isn't well-known and celebrated because she was a woman able to maintain a career as a computer programmer, but because her accomplishments exceeded all of her peers and changed the field of computer science. While I believe that Admiral Hopper cherished her place as a role
  model to women, she was first a computer scientist and second a woman in computer science.
